Assumption:

My first assumption of the game is that it is played on an infinite two dimensional grid. 
Every cell interacts with up to eight neighbours that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 

Death: If a state is 1, then in the next generation the state will be 0.  
A cell dies due to loneliness (1 or fewer live neighbours) or overpopulation (4 or more cells alive).

Birth: This goes from 0 to 1. Exactly 3 live neighbours that are adjacent to an empty cell will give birth to a new cell. 

Stasis: In all other cases the state will remain the same. 

Death and birth will happen simultaneously as the population goes through changes over time.
